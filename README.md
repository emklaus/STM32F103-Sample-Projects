# STM32F103-Sample-Projects
(My first GitHub project  12/23/2017)
A collection of STM32F103 sample projects using the OpenSTM32 IDE

All thes projects were tested ONLY on the STM32F103C8T6 Minimum System Development Board
I've had some experience with ARM microcontrollers with STM32F4 Discovery Board.
That had a more powerful version of the STM32 chip and cost around $20

For quite a while I have been seeing the little ARM board on ebay for under $4 and with some research found that
they contained a factory installed serial bootloader, so no ST-LINK  programmer is required you simply need a 
USB-TTL Serial adapter (of which I have tons of).

This seemed like a good cheap way to go when a project required a more capable CPU than my beloved ATMega32.
I investigated a few of the free development environments that support this chip and (as a novice) found the 
OpemSTM32 System Workbench for STM32 to be just a tad easier than just plain Eclipse and the appropriate plug-ins.

This project is my attempt to share my experiments and provide an easy starting point for those wishing to experience
ARM software development on the cheap.

Not everything here is original work and If I've failed to include the proper credit for something please contact me 
and I'll do my best to correct the problem or remove the code. 

I've tried to include everything you need to simply import a folder into your System Workbench environment.
(the external tools I've added will almost definitely not work without some tweaking)

Another reason for this project is to move the code from my Google website
https://sites.google.com/site/ericmklaus/projects-1/stm32f103-minimum-system-development-board
since I'm running out of space there.
